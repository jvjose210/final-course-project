            <h2>About TasteSaipan</h2>
            <p>TasteSaipan is my CS222 web development project that focuses on my personal recommendations of
                restaurants and and the food culture on Saipan. I
                wanted to build something connected to where I live instead of a random topic from the internet.</p>
            <p>Most of the places shown on this site are spots I’ve seen, heard about, or tried myself. The goal is not
                to list every restaurant, but to share a small list of places I would recommend to visitors or friends.

            <h2>Why TasteSaipan?</h2>
            <p>I built TasteSaipan to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make it easier for visitors or interested people to find places to eat on Saipan without feeling
                    lost and recommendations from someone who has lived here their entire life.</li>
                <li>Help underrated restaurants get a little more attention online.</li>
                <li>Practice real web development skills.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Saipan's Food Culture</h2>
            <p>Saipan’s food scene is a mix of Chamorro, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, American, and other influences. You
                can find everything from BBQ plates and fiesta food to ramen, coffee shops, and beachside restaurants.
            </p>
            <p>Part of this project was paying more attention to the places I pass by every day and turning them into a
                simple online recommendation to everyone.</p>
